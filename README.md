# Final-Portfolio_DCS-325_Peter-Weil

**A brief discussion of what role that topic/tool/framework plays in developing web site:**

  HTML:
    Provides the foundational building blocks for a website. We can use it to develop the context and structure of the website by creating HTML elements. Can create: headers, lists, paragraphs, buttons... 

  CSS:
    Controls the visual representation of the website. We can use CSS to style the elements that we created with HTML. We can define the colors, the spacing and layouts (grid, flexbox). Can also create hover effects and transitions.

  Javascript:
    Logic for the website. Adds interactivity to websites, enabling dynamic content, animations...
  
  SSH:
    Allows us to securely access and transfer files between local and remote servers using encrypted authentication. Allowed us to access catapult through the terminal and made uploading files substantially easier. 

  React: 
    Allows us to build reusable UI components single-page applications. Makes building large websites so much easier because you can reuse your components rather than having to redesign them everytime. Also you don't have to refresh the page for changes to apply.

  Bootstrap: 
    Provides predesigned components and a grid system faster development. Very useful for structuring a website.

  TailwindCSS: 
    Offers CSS classes for rapid, customizable styling in HTML file. All of the CSS can be done in-line. Usually inline is not a good way of doing CSS but Tailwind makes it much more doable.

  Shadcn:
    Similar to bootstrap, it is a collection of accessible, customizable UI components. Works really well with react apps.

  Krug:
    Design principles which focus on making websites accessible, intuitive and easy to use. Adds to critical thinking when assessing websites. So many good concepts included in this book.

  Accessibility:
    Ensures that everyone, even people with disabilities which alter how they interact with website, can use your website.

  Figma:
    Allows for quick prototyping and design with a team. Provides a space for very fast revisions and feedback. 

  Cursor:
    AI tool that can analyze the code youre working on and work with you to develop it. 

  Firebase:
    Google service which allows you to develop backend qualities. You can create a signin page for your website and you can store unique user data on their database so that the user can come and go from the website without losing their progress.

**What was your experience in using React+Vite for building web apps compared to "rolling your own" using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript?:**

  Javascript, HTML and CSS seemed like they were generally a lot more work to implement than react/vite. It seems like there are so many tools and prebuilt components that meshed very well with react-vite. Also, I was reading about the advantages of react and how it can reflect changes without full reloads whereas HTML, Javascript and React require reloading. In the end though, my experience was that HTML, Javascript and CSS were easier. I think this is only because we made small websites where the reusable components and other react advantages were not as obvious. I think that if I work on larger, more complex, websites in the future, the advantages of react will become evident. 

**What are the primary takeaways you had from reading Krug's book and your corresponding analysis of sites?:**

  Krug's book was very informative. I wouldn't have thought of a lot of the things that he went over. While much of it seems intuitive I took for granted how much the things he mentioned inflenuce my experience on a site. A site that follows his design principles well is less frustrating and more intuitive all around. His principles were nice to have in the back of my mind while working on our projects. I also started frequently noticing issues in other peoples websites, things that wouldn't have bothered me before started to bother me which I found funny. Most of what I took away from the book was how to make a site navigatable and how to make a site understandable at a glance without the user having to think.

**What is the importance of accessibility (give a few explicit examples), and what steps can (and should) you take in assessing the accessibility of your site?:**

  Accessibility came into play when considering anyone who might not interact with your site as the majority of people would. Accounting for people who might not be capable of using a mouse or might have vision issues makes your site much more inviting for those people. Some examples of ways we though about this was making every interactable part of a website accessible through the keyboard only. A user should be able to use tab and enter to click on any interactable elements and navigate your site. To make it even more smooth, adding a button at the beginning of your website that moves their cursor to the relevant part of your page immediately adds to this accessiblity by improving their experience. When considering people with vision issues we thought about making it accessible to people with color blindness. Because there are many different types of color blindness, we addressed this by using a very distinct color palate. The colors should stand out against their background. They should contrast each other, that way a color blind user can still differentiate elements and read text. Furthermore, colors shouldn't be necessary for the user to understand your website. For example, if there are elements that convey information through color, adding textures and an associated legend can help color blind users. 

**In what ways did the different design sprints, and use of Figma, help you in thinking about what an end product should look like and how it should function?:**

  The design sprint format was a great was for us to come up with a relatively comprehensive website plan prior to sitting down and coding. Figma provided a great space to prototype in. It was very easy to quickly through together a website prototype with our group. This allowed us to test and edit our plan before going through all of the work of coding it. It gave us the chance to work on structuring, layout, colors, accesssibility, content... We made a lot of changes between our design sprint initial discussion and our figma prototype. This might've gone a bit against the principles in the figma videos we watched but I think this prototyping process was really important for us. Many of the initial ideas we had we decided were not useful or needed to be changed. By prototyping we saved ourselves a lot of time in the long run. Everyone on our team was part of the process which meant everyone was on board with the final product. It also meant that everyone knew what role they would need to play in creating the website and it really would have reduced confusion. Even though we didn't make the final product, I could really tell from the design sprint/figma process, how helpful it would be to a team. Lastly, we were able to show our prototype to the class and get feedback before we started the more time consuming parts of the process.

**What takeaways do you have from working with AI/LLMs through Cursor (or similar) in building web applications?:**

  AI, LLMs and Cursor are great tools to augment our work. They're definitely not perfect and if you want a good final project you have to be very involved. The AI does not know what you envision and that makes it very difficult to create something specific. Furthermore, it takes a great deal of coaxing to get it to do anything you want. You cannot trust it not to break something new everytime it fixes something. Still, it is extremely impressive. I was able to create a lot of really cool things in a very short period of time. It sped up my work significantly. To do anything complex you would really need to know what youre doing. For example, a experienced software engineer will be able to use these tools incomparably better than someone that doesn't know anything (Like me). In my mind, that reinforces how important tradition computer science training will remain going forward even if it changes somewhat. Some other things I learned: length of prompt matters a lot. Sometimes, a long prompt is important to give the AI the context it needs to create something specific, it needs to know what your final ideas will be otherwise it might not properly plan for them in the current step. At the same time, a longer prompt seems to vastly increase the cahnge it will make a mistake, therefore you have to find a middle ground. I've found that usually it is easier to use shorter prompts just because it is easier to keep the good changes and remove the bad ones without restarting entirely. 

  
**What was your favorite thing (or deemed most useful) that we covered this semester, and why?:**

  I really enjoyed learning the fundementals. Learning HTML, Javascript and CSS and actually hosting a website on catapault. I found that project really rewarding and fun. I also thought reading krugs book and our following discussions were really great. I thought about websites completely differently after that. It made me so much more critically sighted.

**What do you wish we had covered, or had covered in more detail, and why?**

  We were able to get such a good overview of the field. Initially I had hoped to have more projects but I realized that understanding the full scope of what there is out there is really useful because it gives us the ability to seek out what we need as we continue to learn. That made me really understand your decision to try to expose us to as many concepts and tools as possible. If I had to choose one thing, it would be doing one more website development project using react midway through the semester, just because I really enjoyed creating the first website in HTML, CSS and Javascript but I was really happy with how the class turned out and had no complaints.
