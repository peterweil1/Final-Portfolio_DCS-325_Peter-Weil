**A brief discussion of what role that topic/tool/framework plays in developing web site:**

  HTML:
    Provides the foundational building blocks for a website. We can use it to develop the context and structure of the website by creating HTML elements. Can create: headers, lists, paragraphs, buttons... 

  CSS:
    Controls the visual representation of the website. We can use CSS to style the elements that we created with HTML. We can define the colors, the spacing and layouts (grid, flexbox). Can also create hover effects and transitions.

  Javascript:
    Logic for the website. x

**What was your experience in using React+Vite for building web apps compared to "rolling your own" using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript?:**

  Javascript, HTML and CSS seemed like they were generally a lot more work to implement than react/vite. It seems like there are so many tools and prebuilt components that meshed very well with react-vite. Also, I was reading about the advantages of react and how it can reflect changes without full reloads whereas HTML, Javascript and React require reloading. In the end though, my experience was that HTML, Javascript and CSS were easier. I think this is only because we made small websites where the reusable components and other react advantages were not as obvious. I think that if I work on larger, more complex, websites in the future, the advantages of react will become evident. 

**What are the primary takeaways you had from reading Krug's book and your corresponding analysis of sites?:**

  Krug's book was very informative. I wouldn't have thought of a lot of the things that he went over. While much of it seems intuitive I took for granted how much the things he mentioned inflenuce my experience on a site. A site that follows his design principles well is less frustrating and more intuitive all around. His principles were nice to have in the back of my mind while working on our projects. I also started frequently noticing issues in other peoples websites, things that wouldn't have bothered me before started to bother me which I found funny. Most of what I took away from the book was how to make a site navigatable and how to make a site understandable at a glance without the user having to think.

**What is the importance of accessibility (give a few explicit examples), and what steps can (and should) you take in assessing the accessibility of your site?:**

  Accessibility came into play when considering anyone who might not interact with your site as the majority of people would. Accounting for people who might not be capable of using a mouse or might have vision issues makes your site much more inviting for those people. Some examples of ways we though about this was making every interactable part of a website accessible through the keyboard only. A user should be able to use tab and enter to click on any interactable elements and navigate your site. To make it even more smooth, adding a button at the beginning of your website that moves their cursor to the relevant part of your page immediately adds to this accessiblity by improving their experience. When considering people with vision issues we thought about making it accessible to people with color blindness. Because there are many different types of color blindness, we addressed this by using a very distinct color palate. The colors should stand out against their background. They should contrast each other, that way a color blind user can still differentiate elements and read text. Furthermore, colors shouldn't be necessary for the user to understand your website. For example, if there are elements that convey information through color, adding textures and an associated legend can help color blind users. 

**In what ways did the different design sprints, and use of Figma, help you in thinking about what an end product should look like and how it should function?:**
